Purpose: The purpose of our code is to be able to find electric fuel pumps, more  
specifically the ones that are closest to the user, when the code is running and
the website is open you can add your address to the search bar and it will show 
the information of the closest electric charger such as the name and the address

Instructions:
1. clone the repository using 'git clone https://github.com/rumkkee/CST205_GroupProject'

2. In your powershell enter the repository directory and run '.\venv\Scripts\activate'

3. Then run the code 'flask --app project run' to see the website or if you wish to run 
   whil modifying it you can run 'flask --app project --debug run' alternatively

4. Then simply enter the webiste that you will find in the powershell which should look
   something like this 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
   
We plan to add multiple other fuel sources other than just electricity in future 
revision of this code aswell as integrating usable maps in the location area.
